# Advent of Code 2020 

I'm using [this year's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) to learn Go! Advice welcome! 

(OK, for Day 6 I caved and used Ruby.)

For the past three years I used Rust for Advent of Code: [2019](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2019), [2018](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2018), and [2017](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2017). In 2015 [I used Ruby](https://github.com/sts10/advent_of_code). I never get very far!
