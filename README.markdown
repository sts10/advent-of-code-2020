# Advent of Code 2020 

I'm using [this year's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) to learn some Go! Advice welcome! 

## But then...

When I got to [Day 7 (Handy Haversacks)](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7), I caved and used Ruby, but was only able to solve part 1. That code is in this repository.

And for Days 8 through 10 I switched Rust. Those solutions are in [a separate repo](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2020-rust).

## Repos of Christmases past

For the past three years I used Rust for Advent of Code: [2019](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2019), [2018](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2018), and [2017](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2017). In 2015 [I used Ruby](https://github.com/sts10/advent_of_code). I never get very far!
